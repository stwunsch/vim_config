# vim_config

My vim config. The idea is to put the config file somewhere with a repo (mainly for backup purposes) and link this file from ~/.vimrc by a symbolic link. Use 'ln -s /home/<...>/vim_config/vimrc /home/<user>/.vimrc'.

Vundle plugin manager is integrated. So don't miss to install Vundle for VIM plugin managing!

I recommend the terminal emulator 'terminator'.

**Features**

- Set mouse support  
- Autohighlight leading/trailing whitespaces  
- Configure autoindent  
- Configure search highlightning  
- Set <Space> for removing search highlightning in window  
- Configure line numbers  
- Vundle integration
