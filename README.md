# vim_config

My vim config. The idea is to put the config file somewhere with a repo (mainly for backup purposes) and link this file from ~/.vimrc.

I recommend the terminal emulator 'terminator'.

**Features**

- Set mouse support  
- Autohighlight leading/trailing whitespaces  
- Configure autoindent  
- Configure search highlightning  
- Set <Space> for removing search highlightning in window  
- Configure line numbers  
- Pathogen integration (run install_pathogen to set up)
